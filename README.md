Project aimed at finding a correlation, causation and make a point for equality through income convergence towards evolution, development and happiness of the populations.

Europe's database Eurostat was the source of all the data collected.
Indicators such as Crime, Education, Health, Migration, Population, Poverty and Work were analised and selected for relevance, cleaned for clarity and processed for insights.

Work incomplete.

Hopefully to be continued.
